## 1. Run with seeds 1, 2, and 3, and compute whether each virtual address generated by the process is in or out of bounds. If in bounds, compute the translation.

## 2. Run with these flags: -s 0 -n 10. What value do you have set -l (the bounds register) to in order to ensure that all the generated virtual addresses are within bounds?

> ./relocation.py -s 0 -n 10 -l 930 -c

Note that the max address has to be LESS than the bounds, since the bounds is 1-based and the addresses are 0-based.

930 (or 0x003a2).


## 3. Run with these flags:-s 1 -n 10 -l 100. What is the maximum value that base can be set to, such that the address space still fits into physical memory in its entirety?

address space is 1k. So the base must be, at most, 16284

16k is the default size of physical address space
16k = 1024 * 16 = 16384

Bounds is 100
so max is 16384 - 100 = 16284


## 4. Run some of the same problems above, but with larger address spaces (-a) and physical memories (-p).

## 5. What fraction of randomly-generated virtual addresses are valid, as a function of the value of the bounds register? Make a graph from running with different random seeds, with limit values ranging from 0 up to the maximum size of the address space.

assuming that:
a = 1k (max addr space size)
p = 16k (max phys space size)
l is the bound (aka limit)
b is the base

f(l) = ml
where 0 <= l <= a

where f(l) grows linearly until it hits 1.0

f(l) is 0 when l = 0
f(l) is 1 when l = a

It is assumed that pl (pl.exe on win32) is in your command PATH or else 
copied into this directory.

   To view script test result images, point your browser to this
	directory.



To run the prefab examples in x11 mode, type:	run_prefabs_test
--------------------------

   There should be no error messages, other than row and field counts.
   For other output modes, add an argument, eg:  run_prefabs_test png

-------------------
   PLOTICUS_CONFIG=plconfig.spanish; export PLOTICUS_CONFIG

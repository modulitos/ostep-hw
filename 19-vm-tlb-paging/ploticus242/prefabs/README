This directory contains files needed for ploticus -prefab operation.

See pltestsuite to run examples.

If you're looking for simple examples that demonstrate ploticus this probably
isn't the right place.. these scripts are more complicated because they 
implement all the functionality of prefabs (they have to accomodate all 
possible parameter combinations that might be specified).  
Check in ./gallery or ./pltestsuite.
